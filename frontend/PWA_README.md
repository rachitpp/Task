# Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation

This project has been enhanced with Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, allowing users to continue working even when offline or with poor internet connectivity.

## Features

- **Offline Access**: Users can access the application even when they're offline
- **Background Sync**: Changes made while offline will sync when connection is restored
- **Cache API**: Important resources are cached for faster load times and offline access
- **IndexedDB Storage**: User data is stored locally for offline use
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time notifications are delivered to the user (when online)
- **Add to Home Screen**: Users can install the app on their devices for quick access

## Technical Implementation

### Service Worker

The service worker handles:

- Caching of static assets
- Network requests with offline fallbacks
- Background synchronization of pending tasks

### Offline Data Storage

We use IndexedDB to store:

- Task data for offline access
- Pending operations queued for sync
- User preferences and authentication data

### Offline-First API Layer

The application includes an offline-first API layer that:

- Attempts online operations first
- Falls back to cached data when offline
- Queues write operations for later synchronization
- Provides a consistent API whether online or offline

## How to Test Offline Support

1. Open the application while online
2. Navigate to different pages to cache routes
3. Use Chrome DevTools to simulate offline status:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Check "Offline" checkbox
4. Try performing these operations while offline:
   - View existing tasks
   - Create new tasks
   - Update task status
   - Mark tasks as complete
5. Return online to see your changes sync with the server

## PWA Installation

Users can install the app on their devices:

1. In Chrome, click the "Install" icon in the address bar
2. On mobile, select "Add to Home Screen" from the browser menu

## Potential Improvements

- Add more sophisticated conflict resolution for offline changes
- Implement more robust error handling for sync failures
- Extend offline support to more features of the application
- Add custom offline UI indicators for a better user experience
